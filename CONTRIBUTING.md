To submit a tip to the list, fork the repository and add your tip in a new file in the correct folder (according language).  The name of the file should be `2016-xx-xx-name-of-your-tip`.

Use [this format](https://github.com/richzw/pytips/blob/master/POST_TEMPLATE.md) when writing your tip. 

### Requirements
- The tip should be readable in less than two minutes
- Adding links to other sites or videos that give more insight is welcome
- Mark Python code with ```python
- Don't mention "JavaScript" in the title (as our tips are about it anyway)
- Use backticks (`) to mark code in the **title** and/or **tip-tldr** fields. _Warning_: Both values must not start with backticks!

Once your tip is ready, [issue a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) and your tip will be reviewed.

# Notes

Leave the date and the tip number as **xx**. When the PR is `ready to merge`, we will tell you the correct numbers. Please also [squash](https://davidwalsh.name/squash-commits-git) your commits.


We are looking forward to your contribution!
