> This is about useful python tips

Inspired by [jstips](https://github.com/loverajoel/jstips), this is an awesome project about short and useful Python tips that 
will allow you to improve your code writing. With less than 2 minutes, you will be able to read about performance, conventions, hacks, 
interview questions and all the items that the future of this awesome language holds for us.

Tips are added frequently (read further if you want to stay in touch). 

### Can you help us enrich it?
Sure, you can help the project in two ways, sending your tip or reviewing future tips.
Any improvements or suggestions are more than welcome!
[Instructions are here](https://github.com/richzw/pytips/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
