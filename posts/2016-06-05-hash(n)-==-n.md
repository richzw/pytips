### Question

I've been playing with Python's hash function. For small integers, it appears hash(n) == n always. However this does not extend to large numbers:

```python
>>> hash(2**100) == 2**100
False
```

I'm not surprised, I understand hash takes a finite range of values. What is that range?

I tried using binary search to find the smallest number `hash(n) != n`

```python
>>> import codejamhelpers # pip install codejamhelpers
>>> help(codejamhelpers.binary_search)
Help on function binary_search in module codejamhelpers.binary_search:

binary_search(f, t)
    Given an increasing function :math:`f`, find the greatest non-negative integer :math:`n` such that :math:`f(n) \le t`.
    If :math:`f(n) > t` for all :math:`n \ge 0`, return None.

>>> f = lambda n: int(hash(n) != n)
>>> n = codejamhelpers.binary_search(f, 0)
>>> hash(n)
2305843009213693950
>>> hash(n+1)
0
```

What's special about `2305843009213693951`? I note it's less than `sys.maxsize == 9223372036854775807`

### Answer

`2305843009213693951` is `2^61 - 1`. It's the largest Mersenne prime that fits into `64` bits.

If you have to make a hash just by taking the value mod some number, then a large Mersenne prime is a good choice -- it's easy to compute
and ensures an even distribution of possibilities. (Although I personally would never make a hash this way)

It's especially convenient to compute the modulus for floating point numbers. They have an exponential component that multiplies the whole 
number by `2^x`. Since `2^61 = 1 mod 2^61-1,` you only need to consider the (exponent) `mod 61`.

Also You can use `math.frexp` in order to get the mantissa and exponent of `sys.maxint` which for a 64 bit machine shows that max int is `263`:

```python
>>> import math
>>> math.frexp(sys.maxint)
(0.5, 64)
```

And you can see the difference by a simple test:

```python
>>> hash(2**62) == 2**62
True
>>> hash(2**63) == 2**63
False
```

As mentioned in comment you can use `sys.hash_info` (in python 3.X) which will give you a struct sequence of parameters used for computing hashes.

```python
>>> sys.hash_info
sys.hash_info(width=64, modulus=2305843009213693951, inf=314159, nan=0, imag=1000003, algorithm='siphash24', hash_bits=64, seed_bits=128, cutoff=0)
```
